# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A fun arcade-style game built with Python’s `turtle` module.  
The goal is to guide your turtle across the road while avoiding moving cars.  
Each time you reach the other side, the level increases and cars move faster.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the game with Python.
   
2. Use the **Up Arrow** key to move your turtle forward.
   
3. Avoid getting hit by cars — one collision ends the game.
   
4. Reach the top of the screen to level up.
